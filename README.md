# PreworkStudyGuide
Study guide for bootcamp :)

- As a bootcamp student, I wanted to create a basic webpage to both get experience with some basic coding languages, but also to have a place where I can store my notes. I also want to be able to update these notes over time to keep this webpage as a consistant, quality resource.
- I built this project to gain some basic coding experience, and to start strong in bootcamp.
- The webpage acts as an evolving reference guide for other beginner web developers.
- During this project, I learned about Git, CSS, HTML, and Javascript. I also learned the developer mindset and the importance of version control when coding.
